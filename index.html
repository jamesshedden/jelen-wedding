        <p>
          We’re getting married in a deconsecrated church in Hampstead called <strong>St Stephen’s, Rossyln Hill</strong> and
          we’ll be having our
          reception at the same venue.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can find more information on public transport options
          <a href="">on the venue’s website</a>. There’s no parking at the venue, but there should be some on-street parking
          available nearby —
          although we can’t guarantee it’ll be unoccupied so if you’re not sure it may be best to use public transport.

          The ceremony starts at <strong>2pm</strong>, so please arrive in good time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll then be having drinks & canapés before dinner & speeches, followed by cake, dancing, tea & coffee and evening
          snacks, with celebrations winding up around <strong>11pm</strong>.

          We’d love to see you dressed up for the special occasion, but we’ll be happy with whatever makes you comfortable. We might be
          outside briefly for confetti, so pack an extra layer as it’s likely to be chilly!
